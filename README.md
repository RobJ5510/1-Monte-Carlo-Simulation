**1-Monte-Carlo-Simulation**

**Description**

This is my first ever financial python project. Started out with just trying to do the actual Monte Carlo simulation, then built it out with the Histogram and CDF, exploring different ways that data can be presented and how to visualise certain aspects of the data set with each plot

**Future Upgrades:**

I have no current plans to do anything with the project. It has acted more for me as a gateway into building more financial projects and functioned as a the first practice for plotting things and calculating things using python.
